# UniFi RTSP Viewport for Raspberry Pi

A lightweight RTSP viewer system for UniFi cameras, designed to emulate the UniFi Protect Viewport experience using a Raspberry Pi with minimal overhead.

## Features
- Auto-launching tiled RTSP stream display
- Automatic stream health monitoring and restart
- Graphical layout selector and camera assignment tool
- Low-latency `mpv` playback
- Works with Raspberry Pi OS Lite + minimal X11 setup

---

## üß∞ Initial Raspberry Pi Setup

**Recommended OS:** Raspberry Pi OS Lite 64-bit (for performance and minimal footprint)

### 1. Flash Raspberry Pi OS Lite
Use the [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) to install **Raspberry Pi OS Lite (64-bit)**.

### 2. Log in via SSH or directly
Set hostname, timezone, WiFi, etc. via `raspi-config` if needed:
```bash
sudo raspi-config
```

### 3. Expand Filesystem
(Optional but recommended):
```bash
sudo raspi-config  # Choose: Advanced Options ‚Üí Expand Filesystem
```

---

## üñ•Ô∏è Lightweight GUI Setup (Optional for Headless Users)

If you'd like to use the graphical layout selector or run a full screen tiled display, run the GUI setup script:

```bash
cd ~/unifi-viewport
chmod +x installgui.sh
./installgui.sh
```

Then manually run:
```bash
sudo raspi-config
# System Options ‚Üí Boot / Auto Login ‚Üí Desktop Autologin
```

---

## üöÄ Project Setup

### 1. Clone the repository:
```bash
sudo apt install git -y
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/jsetsuda/unifi-viewport.git
cd unifi-viewport
```

### 2. Run install script:
```bash
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

This will set up the `.env` file, create a virtual environment, install Python dependencies, and fetch your UniFi camera URLs.

---

## üîÑ Reboot
```bash
sudo reboot
```

The system will boot into the layout chooser GUI. After 10 seconds, it will default to the last saved layout if no interaction occurs.

---

## üß™ Development and Testing
This system includes:
- `layout_chooser.py`: UI to select layout and assign cameras
- `get_streams.py`: Fetches camera info from UniFi Protect
- `monitor_streams.py`: Monitors stream health and restarts crashed streams
- `overlay_box.py`: Adds on-screen overlay indicators
- `viewport.sh`: Starts and tiles all streams

---

## üîê GitHub Authentication
GitHub requires a personal access token (PAT) instead of a password. [Generate a token here](https://github.com/settings/tokens) and use it in place of your password when pushing code.

---

## üìÇ Files Used
- `.env`: Environment config (host, username, password)
- `camera_urls.json`: Auto-generated camera list
- `viewport_config.json`: Layout config created by GUI
- `camera_urls.txt`: (Optional) fallback text file for URLs

## üîß Configuring UniFi Protect for RTSP H.264 Streams

To ensure compatibility and optimal performance with this project, you should configure each camera in UniFi Protect to expose an H.264 RTSP stream. Here's how:

1. Open the **UniFi Protect** web interface.
2. Click on the desired camera.
3. Go to the **Settings** (gear icon).
4. Navigate to **Advanced** > check the desired resolution for RTSPS stream.
5. Enable one of the streams (typically "High", "Medium", or "Low") with **H.264** encoding.
6. Note: Under **"Recording Settings"** go to Recording Quality and under Encoding click "Standard" to allow H.264 instead of H.265 (currently issues with this codec)
7. Make note of the stream label (e.g., `rtspAlias`) or confirm its availability using the `get_streams.py` script.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Avoid using HEVC (H.265) streams unless you are certain your Raspberry Pi can handle them with hardware acceleration, as this may cause decoding errors.

After updating the settings, rerun:
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python get_streams.py
```
to regenerate your `camera_urls.json` with updated stream URLs.
